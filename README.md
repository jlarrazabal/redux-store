## Summary:

For this project, a fully operational application was provided in the source code. The work entailed modifying the initial code to work with REDUX instead of context to handle the application's global state.

## Functionality:

This application is an e-Shopping portal that allows users to select any item from the products offered, add them to the Shopping Cart, and proceed to the checkout using stripe.

## Deployed App Link:
